    <p>You created this offer here on FreedomSponsors, but the guys working on <a href="{{offer.issue.project.homeURL}}" target="_project">{{offer.issue.project.name}}</a> don't know about it yet.</p>
    <p>The best way to let them know is to post a comment on the <a href="{{offer.issue.trackerURL}}" target="_issue">original issue</a>.<br>
      Go ahead and copy the text below if you like:

    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p> Hi everyone. I need this bug/feature so much that I'm willing to pay {{offer.price}} bucks for it.<br>
        This offer is registered at FreedomSponsors ({{SITE_HOME}}{{offer.issue.get_view_link}}).<br>
        Once you solve it (according to the acceptance criteria described there), just create a FreedomSponsors account and mark it as resolved (oh, you'll need a Paypal account too)<br>
        I'll then check it out and will gladly pay up!<br><br>

        If anyone else would like to throw in a few bucks to elevate the priority on this issue, you should check out FreedomSponsors!
