          <p>FreedomSponsors is a crowdfunding platform for programming tasks of Free and Open Source Software.</p>
			<p>You can place money bounties for issues that you care about getting fixed, and you can collect bounties by working on open issues.</p>

          <h3 class="green-text">What makes FreedomSponsors different from other crowdfunding sites?</h3>

          <p>
The main difference is that we are focused on helping the Open Source and Free Software community.<br>
But we believe that what really makes us unique is that we have a strong philosophy based on openness and freedom.<br>
That philosophy means we put the community first in everything we do. Here's a few examples:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>

We want to build a community based on trust and reputation.
Sponsors only have to pay their bounty after the developer resolves the issue (but you can choose to pay before, if you wish.)
              </li>
              <li>
We want to build free, libre, open source software.
Our users' software freedom is important to us, so <a href="https://github.com/freedomsponsors/www.freedomsponsors.org">this website is libre/open source</a> on the front-end <strong>and the back end</strong>. We don't use third-party javascript code that can allow our users' online activities to be spied on. This includes Google Analytics, Facebook Like buttons, and things like that. We also follow the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">FSF guidelines for free, libre javascript code</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
We want to be the change we wish to see in the world.
We're "open everything", so everything we do is out in the open: 
Check out our <a href="/core/stats/">website statistics</a>, 
browse our <a href="http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/">blog</a>, 
and see the way we handle all <a href="http://freedomsponsors.org/core/feedback">feedback</a>. 
It has a lot in common with the <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">"open company" concept</a> 
pioneered by our friends at <a href="http://gittip.com">Gittip</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Last but not least, FreedomSponsors is proudly made in Brazil. If you ever come visit, let's get together and have some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha">caipirinhas</a>! :-)

            Yes. Honestly, we do. <br>
            We believe that there are enough decent, honest people in the world for this to work.<br>
A wise guy once said, stay foolish. We intend to do just that.<br>

            Have you heard of <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_agile">the Agile Manifesto</a>? 
Freedom Sponsors is all about taking the third Agile principle to its ultimate consequence: 
<strong>"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation."</strong><br>
We want to give people the ability to push forwards the projects they love. No contracts, just trust that developers also love these projects too, and feel happy when they can be paid to put more work into them.

            Like eBay, you should check out their profile and take a look at their history. If there are a lot of unpaid offers on resolved issues, that's a bad sign.

          <a name="How do payments work?"></a>
          <h3 class="green-text">How do payments work?</h3>
          <p>
              Payments can be made either in USD via Paypal, or in <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoins</a>. Before you can send payments, you’re going to need a Paypal account or a Bitcoin wallet. Before you can receive payments, set up both so you can accept all offers. We check that each Paypal account is valid before allowing anyone to make a payment to it.
          </p>
          <p>
              Freedom Sponsors charges a 3% fee on top of offers, regardless of the payment method. We clearly state this on each payment page. To keep things simple, we use Paypal’s <strong>Parallel</strong> payment type, so a single payment is sent to two or more receivers.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
              For example, when you want to pay a US$10 bounty, you may decide to give US$5 each to 2 developers. On Paypal’s website, you will see:<br>

              <ul>
                <li>Developer A: USD $5</li>
                <li>Developer B: USD $5</li>
                <li>Freedom Sponsors' 3% fee: USD $0.30</li>
                <li>PayPal's Fee: USD $1.03 (may vary)</li>
                <li>TOTAL: USD $11.33</li>
              </ul>

              Bitcoin has no “parallel payment.” Instead, you send us, we verify the transaction, keep 3%, and transfer the rest to the developer(s) being paid.<br><br>
              Since our system is libre, you can <a href="https://github.com/freedomsponsors/www.freedomsponsors.org">review the code</a> that processes transactions for both Paypal and Bitcoin.

            <p>
                It is okay for commenting. To send or receive payments, you’ll need to set up one of these options on <a href="/core/user/edit">your profile page</a>.

          <p>
First, verify that the issue is really solved. 
We encourage you to pay only after your problem is really fixed.<br><br>

Then you have to decide whether you'll pay developer A, developer B, or both. 
To make a fair choice, do a little digging and check out the original issue to see how it went down.<br> 
Maybe one person submitted a pull request for a bugfix, and another person had to rework it and then merged it. 
If so, they both deserve some thanks, and your money. You decide how much you pay to whom. The choice is yours.

          <h3 class="green-text">How a fix done by an independent developer will return back to the main project (trunk)?</h3>
          <p>
Ideally, there should be no "independent developers". 
The best way for a developer to contribute to an open source project is to actually get involved 
with the corresponding community.<br>
In most cases, it is also a bad thing for the end user (meaning, the sponsor) if the work is done 
on a branch, or a fork of the main codebase, because then the user would not benefit from new improvements 
that eventually get added in the future.<br><br>

The "Sponsor issue" form has a "No Forking" checkbox as part of the acceptance criteria. 
By checking it, the sponsor is telling that only solutions that are implemented on the main project's 
codebase will be accepted.<br>
We want to encourage sponsors to actually fund the original projects, so that checkbox comes checked by default.
          </p>

          <h3 class="green-text">I resolved an issue, but the sponsor just didn't pay me. What can I do?</h3>
          <p>
Normally we have an atmosphere of gratitude and collaboration among sponsors and developers.
However we do know that conflict situations may come up.<br>

Try to resolve conflict with compassion. 
An excellent book that explains how to do this is <a href="http://www.cnvc.org">Marshall Rosenberg's 
"Non-Violent Communication: A Language of Life"</a>. 
Simply, tell them how you feel without judging them or evaluating the situation, then request a description 
of what their ideal situation is, and ask for suggestion about how to get there.<br>
If you feel upset, and judge the sponsor as not trustworthy, remember that the issue - and its comment 
history - will be publicly linked to the sponsor's account. 
If you feel unhappy, we suggest you go to sleep before posting anything you might later regret. 
<!-- TODO In the worst case, you can mark an issue as 'CONFLICTED.' 
  Next to every username is the PAID/CONFLICTED score, 
  which shows the total number of issues the user is involved in that are now PAID or CONFLICTED. 
  EG, "davelab6 57/1" in green/red. --> <br>

          </h3>
          <p>
              Yes. When you start working on an issue, simply check the “start accepting payments” box, and kindly ask your patrons to pay you.<br>
              We recommend only doing this when you're confident that you will be able to complete the issue on time and on budget. If you think the total payment should be higher, track down some other users who suffer from this issue and ask them to check it out on FreedomSponsors.

          </h3>
          <p>
It depends.<br> 
Normally you have to wait until the developer has marked the issue as “DONE”.<br>
However you can do this when the issue is 
<!-- TODO remove the _ from this throughout the site --> 
“IN_PROGRESS” <strong>and</strong> the developer has indicated that they wish to start accepting payments. 
But remember that it's ok to wait until the issue is finished before you pay the developer.<br>
We encourage to only pay beforehand to developers you know you can trust!
